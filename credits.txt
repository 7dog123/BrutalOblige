This mod uses some code from Sgt Mark IV's Bolognese mod in addition to reusing/adapting some code from Brutal Doom itself

This mod uses some code from the ObAddon project: https://github.com/caligari87/ObAddon
As with the code in vanilla Oblige this code is GPL3.
At the moment this is the code from the render.lua script to allow skyboxes. The skybox prefabs being used are original.
